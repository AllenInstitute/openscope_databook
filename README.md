## OpenScope Jupyterhub Library!

This library is meant to store projects used for brain data processing and visualization, primarily working with the *DANDI archive* and *.NWB* files. This library is provided by the Allen Institute's **OpenScope** Project. **OpenScope** is a platform for high-throughput and reproducible neurophysiology open to external scientists to test theories of brain function.
