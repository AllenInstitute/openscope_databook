    "# Exploring an NWB File\n",
    "It can get cumbersome to manually dissect an NWB file with print statements. There are a few ways to view an NWB graphically instead. A great way to do this in a Jupyter notebook is with [NWBWidgets](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwbwidgets). Here, you can use NWBWidgets to view a file from a location on your machine. If you don't want to download a file just to view it, you can still use NWBWidgets to view it remotely. Check out *Stream an NWB File with fsspec* to learn how to do this. Another way to explore an NWB file, that doesn't require Jupyter, is with [HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/)."

The `nwb2widget` function will display the NWB file embedded in the notebook with each of the fields and subfields as a widget. NWB Files can vary a lot in their specific structure, so it can be important to familiarize with the structure of the data you're working with."
