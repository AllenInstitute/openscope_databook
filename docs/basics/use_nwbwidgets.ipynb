    "# Exploring an NWB File\n",
    "It can get cumbersome to manually dissect an NWB file with print statements. There are a few ways to view an NWB graphically instead. A great way to do this in a Jupyter notebook is with **[NWBWidgets](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwbwidgets)**. Here, you can use NWBWidgets to view a file from a location on your machine. If you don't want to download a file just to view it, you can still use NWBWidgets to view it remotely. Check out [Streaming an NWB File with fsspec](./stream_nwb.ipynb) to learn how to do this. Another way to explore an NWB file, that doesn't require Jupyter, is with [HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/)."
