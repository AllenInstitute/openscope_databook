    "# Visualizing Neuropixel Probe Locations\n",
    "It can be handy to know the location and trajectory of the probes that obtain the data. Some NWB files have an **electrodes** field which store these locations. To be more precise, they contain arrays of **CCF** coordinates. [CCF](https://community.brain-map.org/t/allen-mouse-ccf-accessing-and-using-related-data-and-tools/359) is a framework which allows us to represent locations in the brain with coordinates that are relative to brain structure. This notebook uses CCF coordinate data in an extracellular electrophysiology NWB file to render the locations of the [Neuropixel](https://www.neuropixels.org/probe) probes that were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to render locations in a brain, you don't need to know how CCF works except that it is a system of coordinates. You also need to ensure that the brain model being used to visualize probes are appropriate for the CCF data used. In this case, we use a mouse brain atlas to work with our mouse CCF data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use **[brainrender](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender)** as the engine by which we 3D render the brain and the probe coordinates."
