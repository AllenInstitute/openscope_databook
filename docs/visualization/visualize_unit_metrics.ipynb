    "This Jupyter notebook will provide a detailed explanation of the unit quality metrics included in ecephys NWB Files. It's important to pay attention to quality metrics, because failing to apply them correctly could lead to invalid scientific conclusions, or could end up hiding potentially useful data. To help you avoid these pitfalls, this tutorial will explore how these metrics are calculated, how they can be biased, and how they should be applied to specific use cases. It's important to keep in mind that none of these metrics are perfect, and that the use of unit quality metrics for filtering ephys data is still an evolving area of research. More work is required in order to establish general-purpose best practices and standards in this domain."

Quality metrics allow us to understand the types of mistakes that are occurring, and obtain an estimate of their severity. Some common errors that can be identified by quality metrics include:\n",

It's misleading to conceive of units as existing in two distinct categories, one with perfectly clean \"single units\" and one with impure \"multiunits.\" Instead, there's a gradient of qualities, with mostly complete, uncontaminated units at one end, and incomplete, highly contaminated units at the other.\n",

    "Despite the fact that there's not a clear division between single-unit and multi-unit activity, we still have to make a binary decision in every analysis we carry out: should this unit be included or not? Ideally this decision should be based on objective metrics that will not bias the end results. By default, the AllenSDK uses three quality metrics, isi_violations, amplitude_cutoff, and presence_ratio, to filter out units that are likely to be highly contaminated or missing lots of spikes. However, the default values of these filters may not be appropriate for your analysis, or you may want to disable them entirely. Reading through this tutorial will give you a better understanding of how these (and other) metrics should be applied, so you can apply them effectively throughout your own explorations of this dataset."

You can interpret an ISI violations value of 0.5 as meaning that contamining spikes are occurring at roughly half the rate of \"true\" spikes for that unit. In cases of highly contaminated units, the ISI violations value can sometimes be even greater than 1."
