    "# Visualizing Neuropixels Probe Locations\n",
    "**Note: This notebook currently does not work on Google Colab, or Dandihub. Please try running it locally**\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be handy to know the location and trajectory of the probes that obtain the data. Some NWB files have an **electrodes** field which stores these locations. To be more precise, they contain arrays of *CCF* coordinates. [CCF](https://community.brain-map.org/t/allen-mouse-ccf-accessing-and-using-related-data-and-tools/359) is a framework which represents locations in the brain with coordinates that are relative to predefined brain structures in a model brain. This notebook uses CCF coordinate data in an extracellular electrophysiology NWB file to render the locations of the [Neuropixels](https://www.neuropixels.org/probe) probes that were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to render locations in a brain, you don't need to know how CCF works except that it is a system of coordinates. We use the **[ccf-widget](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/ccf-widget)** library to 3D render the brain and the probe coordinates."
